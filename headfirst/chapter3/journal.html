    <p>Well I made it 1200 miles already, and I passed through interesting places on
        the way:<!--  Walla Walla, WA, Magic City, ID, Boutiful, UT, Last Chance, CO, Why, AZ
        and Truth or Consequences, NM. -->

        <ol>

    <p>I saw some Burma Shave style signs on the side of the road today: 
        <blockquote>
            Passing cars,<br>
            When you can't see,<br>
            May get you,<br>
            Aglimpse,<br> 
            Of eternity. I denfinitely won't be passing any cars.
        </blockquote>
    </p>

    <p>My first day of the trip!. I can't belive I finally got everything packed 
        and ready to go. Because I'm on a Segway, I wasn't able to bring a whole lot with 
        me:
        <ul>
            <li>cell phone,</li>
            <li>Ipod,</li>
            <li>digital camera,</li>
            <li>and a protein bar.</li>
        </ul>
        Just the essentials. As 
        Lao Tzu would have said, <q>A journey of a thousand miles begins with one step Segway.</q>
